# CSC591-Generative_Methods

NC State Unviersity. CSC 591 - Generative Methods

Me and another student had to come up with a project that used some sort of generative method. We chose to make a 2D map maker that you could use for tabletop roleplaying games. Our map takes input of size and whether you want water or not and then creates a 2D grid where there are different colord blocks that represent different things. Gray blocks are where you can walk around, blue blocks mean water, brown mean bridges, and the other colors represent shops, inns, etc. A 3D model of the map is also created so that you can walk around and see what was generated. I was in charge of creating the walking path, bridges, and river. If you want to read about what algorithms we used and how we created the other blocks, you can read the report.
