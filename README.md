# CSC591-Generative_Methods

NC State Unviersity. CSC 591 - Generative Methods

Me and another student had to come up with a project that used some sort of generative method. We chose to make a 2D map maker that you could use for tabletop roleplaying games. Our map takes a couple of inputs and then creates a map grid where there are different colord blocks that represent different things like shops, bridges, water, etc.
