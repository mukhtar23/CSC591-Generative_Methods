# Prototype
![3d_minimap](3d_minimap.png?raw=true "Title")
(Sorry, this is just a image prototype, I don't have the 2D minimap embedded in the 3D webGL part.)

# Usage
1. Open index.html
2. Choose your parameter from the dropdown widget, it work the best when using "large"
3. Click "generate"
4. **Scroll down to see the 3D viewer!**
    - click the 3D viewer to start interaction, you can move by <kdb>WASD</kdb> and use <kdb>Space</kdb> to jump, use <kdb>mouse</kdb> to look around
    - when you want to leave, press <kdb>Esc</kdb> so it will cancel catching your input.
5. Sometimes 3d viewer may blank out, just refresh to regenerate
6. 3D viewer use webGL so your computer may scream and being laggy if you don't have a dedicated graphics card
